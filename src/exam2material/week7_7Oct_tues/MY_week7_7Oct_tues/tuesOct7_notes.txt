Domain: Snickers, Kit Kat, Skittles, Pay Day, Starburst

Predicates: 
    HasChocolate(x)
    IsBrown(x)
    ContainsPeanuts(x)

///

Statements:


HasChocolate(PayDay) V ContainsPeanuts(KitKat)

    translation? Payday has chocolate or KitKat has peanuts
    true or false? false


///
Domain: Snickers, Kit Kat, Skittles, Pay Day, Starburst

¬(∀ x (HasChocolate(x) → ContainsPeanuts(x)))

(Without Negation - All candy with cocholate also contains peanuts)

    translation? Not all candy with chocolate contains peanuts
    true or false? true (b/c KitKat has chocolate but no peanuts)



///
Domain: Snickers, Kit Kat, Skittles, Pay Day, Starburst

∀ x (¬ContainsPeanuts(x))

    translation? All candy doesn't have peanuts
    true or false? false (Payday, Snickers)


///
Domain: Snickers, Kit Kat, Skittles, Pay Day, Starburst

¬(∃ x IsBrown(x))

(Without Negation - There is a candy that is brown)

    translation? There's no candy that is brown
    true or false? false (KitKat, Snickers both brown)

///
Domain: Snickers, Kit Kat, Skittles, Pay Day, Starburst

∃ x ¬IsBrown(x)

    translation? There is a candy that is not brown
    true or false? true (Starburst, Skittles)

///
Domain: Snickers, Kit Kat, Skittles, Pay Day, Starburst

∃ x (HasChocolate(x) → ContainsPeanuts(x))

    translation? 
        There is a candy and if that candy has chocolate then it contains peanuts

    (HasChocolate(Snickers) -> ContainsPeanuts(Snickers)) OR ... OR ((HasChocolate(Starburst) -> ContainsPeanuts(Starburst)))


    true or false? true (Snickers, and Starburst/Skittles doesn't have chocolate - Implies being vacously true)

Evaluating predicate logic statements

Our domain is k1...kn

1) ∀ x P(x)
    true when: P(k) is true for every k in our domain
    false when: We can find P(k) false for any k 1 in our domain

2) ∃ x P(x)
    true when: P(k) is true for at least 1 k in our domain
    false when: P(k) is false for every k in our domain

3) ¬(∀ x P(x))
    true when: P(k) is false for at least 1 k in our domain
    false when: P(k) is true for every k in our domain

4) ¬(∃ x P(x))
    true when: P(k) is false for every k in our domain
    false when: P(k) is true for at least 1 k in our domain

5) ∀ x ¬P(x)
    true when: P(k) is false for all k in our domain
    false when: P(k) is true for at least 1 k in our domain

6) ∃ x ¬P(x)
    true when: P(k) is false for at least 1 k in our domain
    false when: P(k) is true for every k in our domain

Domain: ℤ (the integers)


What do these mean in English? Are they true?


∀ n ∃ m (n^2 < m)

    The square of every integer is less than some other integer

    True. Whatever n is, choose m = n^2 + 1 and it will be an integer bigger than 1


∀ x ∃ y (x == y^2)
    All integers are perfect squares

    False. 3 is an integer and it isn't a perfect square


∀ n ∃ m (n^2 == m)
    The square of all integers is also an integer

    True. (Intergers are closed under multiplication)

∃ m ∀ n (n^2 == m)
   There is 1 number that equals the square of all other intergers

   False.

∀ ∃     ∈ ∉     ∅ ⋂ ⋃ ⊂ ⊆   ⋀ ⋁ ¬ →     ℕ ℤ     ≠ ≤ ≥

/////////////////////////


Write the following in predicate logic (Domain: ℤ):
----------------------------------------

The sum of two negative integers is negative

2 quantifiers (for 2 variables)

∀ n ∀ m (n < 0 ⋀ m < 0 → n + m < 0)

True.


The difference of two positive integers is
not necessarily positive

∃ n ∃ m (n > 0 ⋀ m > 0 ⋀ n - m <= 0)

OR:

¬(∀ n ∀ m (n > 0 ⋀ m > 0 → n - m > 0))


True. (n = 5, m = 20 , 5-20 is <= 0)

∀ ∃     ∈ ∉     ∅ ⋂ ⋃ ⊂ ⊆   ⋀ ⋁ ¬ →     ℕ ℤ     ≠ ≤ ≥

/////////////////////////

Equivalence: DeMorgan's law (part 1).

¬(∃ x P(x))         ∀ x (¬P(x))


suppose our domain is k1 through kn


¬(∃ x P(x)) is  equivalent to... ¬(P(k1) ⋁ ... ⋁ P(kn))
which is: ∀ x ¬P(x) 

/////////////////////////

∀ ∃     ∈ ∉     ∅ ⋂ ⋃ ⊂ ⊆   ⋀ ⋁ ¬ →     ℕ ℤ     ≠ ≤ ≥

/////////////////////////

Equivalence: DeMorgan's law (part 2).

¬(∀ x P(x))       ∃ x (¬P(x))


suppose our domain is k1 through kn



¬(∀ x P(x)) is equivalent to...




//////////////////////////////////////

Apply DeMorgan's laws: example


1) Express the statement in predicate logic

2) Negate the statement so no negation is outside a quantifier
or outside a statement with logical connectives

    Reminder:
        p → q is equivalent to (OR statement): (¬p ⋁ q)
        ¬(p ⋀ q) is equivalent to: ¬p ⋁ ¬q
        ¬(p ⋁ q) is equivalent to: ¬p ⋀ ¬q

///
Domain: students
    in5th(x): student x is in 5th grade
    wonPrize(x): student x won a prize
    friendsWith(x, y): student x is friends with student y

///

∀ ∃     ∈ ∉     ∅ ⋂ ⋃ ⊂ ⊆   ⋀ ⋁ ¬ →     ℕ ℤ     ≠ ≤ ≥

/////////////////////////

All prize-winners were 5th graders

Translation: 

∀ x (wonPrize(x) → in5th(x))

Negation: ¬(∀ x (wonPrize(x) → in5th(x)))

∃ x ¬(wonPrize(x) → in5th(x))
∃ x ¬(¬wonPrize(x) ⋁ in5th(x))
∃ x wonPrize(x) ⋀ ¬in5th(x)

Translation of negation: There is a prize winner who wasn't a 5th grader

///

A 5th grade prize winner isn't friends with anyone

translation: 

∃ x ∀ y (wonPrize(x) ⋀ in5th(x) ⋀ ¬(friendsWith(x, y)))

negate: 
¬(∃ x ∀ y (wonPrize(x) ⋀ in5th(x) ⋀ ¬(friendsWith(x, y))))
∀ x ∃ y ¬(wonPrize(x) ⋀ in5th(x) ⋀ ¬(friendsWith(x, y)))
∀ x ∃ y ¬(wonPrize(x) ⋀ in5th(x)) ⋁ friendsWith(x, y)
∀ x ∃ y wonPrize(x) ⋀ in5th(x) → friendsWith(x, y)

translation of negation: 
    All 5th grade prize winners are friends with someone

Arguments in predicate logic

Set of premises
Conclusion

Argument is VALID: regardless of domain,
    whenever all the premises are true,
    then the conclusion is also true

Argument is INVALID: we can find a domain where
    all the premises are true but the conclusion is false



Examples -- are the following arguments valid?

///

Premises: ∀ x (P(x) → Q(x)), ∃ x P(x)
Conclusion: ∃ x Q(x)

Valid or not? 


///

Premises: ∀ x P(x) : everyone in my domain is P-ish
Conclusion: ∃ x P(x): there is someone in domain who is P-ish

Valid or not? 

/////////////////////////////////

Proofs in predicate logic.

- want to formalize the kind of reasoning from above

- want valid inference rules that do NOT depend on the domain
    (there is no way to do the equivalent of a
    "truth table proof" in predicate logic...
        there are infinitely many domains!)

- add inference rules on quantifiers to our deduction rules


////////////////////////////////

Writing predicate logic statements in Logika

In Logika, ∀ x P(x) is written as:

    ∀ ((x: T) => P(x))



In Logika, ∃ x P(x) is written as:

    ∃ ((x: T) => P(x))



--> what is "T"?


Settings->Command Palette->Tasks (run task)->Sireum slang template->
    Insert a for-all quantification

This will insert the statement:

∀((ID: TYPE) => CLAIM)



(similarly, insert a there exists statement)


You can also edit the keyboard shortcuts for these templates

////////////////////////////////

When you have homework or we do examples, the proof files
will look like this:

// #Sireum #Logika

import org.sireum._
import org.sireum.justification._
import org.sireum.justification.natded.prop._
import org.sireum.justification.natded.pred._

@pure def ProofName[T](pred1: T => B @pure, pred2: T => B @pure,
                ..., indiv1: T, indiv2: T, ...): Unit = {
    Deduce(
        (comma-separated list of premises)
            ⊢
        (conclusion)

        Proof(
            //the actual proof steps go here
        )
    )
}

///////////////////////////////

For-all elimination (∀e):

           ∀ ((x: T) => P(x))
AllE[T]:  ---------------------
                   P(v)

//where v is a particular individual in the domain
//(i.e, v has type T)


Idea:

- if we know that a statement is true for ALL individuals in
our domain


...then what would we know about a specific individual
in that domain?

///////////////////////////////

Syntax:

(
    ∀ ((x: T) => Human(x))
)
⊢
( Human(Socrates) )

Proof(
    1 ( ∀ ((x: T) => Human(x)) )    by Premise,
    2 Human(Socrates)               by ???
)

Note: This assumes "Socrates" and "Human" were both parameters
to our proof function:


@pure def Example[T](Human: T => B @pure, Socrates: T)



///////////////////////////////

Example (all1.sc)


∀ x (inCIS301(x) → takenCIS200(x)), inCIS301(bob) ⊢ takenCIS200(bob)
