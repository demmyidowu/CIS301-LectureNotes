HW 7 due Tuesday, October 28

/////////////////////////////

Today: 
- finish predicate logic
- mathematical induction

/////////////////////////////

Skipping proofs of DeMorgan's laws for quantifers to move on to induction.

Those would be great practice for next exam -- the proof files are in week9_21Oct_tues

/////////////////////////////


Soundness and completeness of predicate logic.


Soundness: definition? Everything that we can prove with our proof system is actually true

    propositional: yes

    predicate logic: yes

    (Same for any proof system)


Completeness: definition? Can use our proof system to prove anything that is true

    propositional: yes

    predicate logic: no

        Premise: All x P(x)
        Conclusion: Exists x P(x)

        - Not true when domain is empty



///////////////////////////////////

Same argument might be VALID in one domain and INVALID in another

- deduction can only prove arguments that are valid in ANY domain
- we can't prove all valid arguments


Domain with integers with operations like +


All integers? 2 + 3 = 5


Subset (0,1,2,3,4) of integers. 2 + 3 = 0



////////////////////////////////////


Godel's Incompleteness Theorem.

Any consistent formal system where integer arithmetic is
carried out is incomplete -- there will be true statements
that cannot be proved.

(depends on domains/interpretations)

/////////////////////

////////////////////////////////////////

Example:

We want to prove that for any positive integer n:

    1 + 2 + ... + n = n*(n+1)/2


(Carl Gauss)


Try it out first.
    n = 1?

    n = 2?

    n = 3?


Have we proved it yet?

NO

///////////////////////////////////////////

Mathematical induction.

Tool for proving some claim P(n) holds for all natural numbers n



The induction domino effect:

    ( P(1) ∧ ∀ k (P(k) → P(k+1)) ) → ∀ n P(n) 




What is this saying?
    P(1)? Base case. Prove that my claim holds for n = 1

    ∀ k (P(k) → P(k+1))? Inductive Step. For any natural number k, if the claim holds for k, then 
                        it holds for k + 1

                        Pick a random individual in your domain (k).
                            Assume P(k)
                            Try to prove P(k+1)

    ∀ n P(n) ? for all natural numbers the claim holds

Putting it all together:

( P(1) ∧ ∀ k (P(k) → P(k+1)) ) → ∀ n P(n) 



English translation?



////////////////////////////////////

Why are we doing this?

////////////////////////////////////

Revisit our example:

We want to prove that for any positive integer n:

    1 + 2 + ... + n = n*(n+1)/2




Proof by induction.

Base Case. We must prove that our claim holds for the first positive integer (n = 1)
    We have that: 1 = 1*(1+2)/2
    The Base Case Holds.

Inductive Step. We assume the inductive hypothesis -- that our laim holds for some fixed positive integer k
    We must show that our claim holds for k+1

    If our claim holds for k then we have:
        1 + 2 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2

    To prove our claim holds for k + 1, we must show:
        1 + 2 + ... + k + k+1 = (k+1)((k+1) + 1)/2

    We have that: 
        1 + 2 + ... + k + k+1 = k(k+1)/2 + k+1 (By inductive hypothesis)
                            = (k(k+1) + 2(k+1))/2
                            = ((k+1)(k+2))/2 
                            = (k+1)((k+1) + 1)/2

The inductive step holds.

We have shown with induction that our claim holds for any positive integer


/////////////////////////////////

(in-class quiz)

/////////////////////////////////

Do you think induction can be used to prove properties for
    ALL integers?

    Must have a smallest value in the domain


/////////////////////////////////

Induction template.

1) Label Base Case. Prove claim is true for smallest element in your domain


2) Label the Inductive Step. "Assume the inductive hypothesis - that <insert claim> holds
    for some fixed k in <insert domain>"


3) Try to prove for k+1. "We must show that our claim holds for k+1"

4) Summarize. "It follows by induction that <insert claim> holds for all <insert domain>"

/////////////////////////////////

Example: Prove that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n^2.

    (what is our domain?)


How can we express the sum of the first n odd numbers more formally?



So, what is our claim?



Proof by induction.


/////////////////////////////////

Example: Prove that 3^n - 1 is even for all positive integers n.


what does "even" mean? 
    A numeber is even if there exists an integer a such that k = 2a


Proof by induction.

Base Case. We must prove that our claim holds for our smallest positive integer n = 1
    We have that 3^1 - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2. Because 2 = 2*1, and 1 is an integer, we know 2 is even.
    Base Case Holds

Inductive Step. Assume the inductive hypothesis -- that 3^k - 1 is even for some positive integer k
    We must show that 3^(k+1) - 1 is even.

    If 3^k - 1 is even, then there exists an integer a such that 2a = 3^k - 1

    We have that:
        3^k(k+1) - 1 = 3(s^k) - 1
                     = 3(3^k - 1) - 1 + 3
                     = 3(2a) + 2 (by inductive hypothesis)
                     = 2(3a + 1)
    Thus 

//////////////////////////////////

Bad induction, example 1.

Use induction to prove that in any nonempty set of n horses, all horses are the same color.

Base Case. I have a set of one horse. Of course it is the same color.

Inductive Step. Assume inductive hypothesis, that for some. fixed positive integer k, 
    that a set of k horses all has the same color

    We must show that a set of k+1 horses all have the same color.
    
    Exclude the first horse from our k+! set. We would have k horses left, and 
    those horses all have the same color by our inductive hypothesis

    Exclude the last horse from our k+1 set. We have k horses left, and those horses all have
    the same color by our inductive hypothesis.


//////////////////////////////////

Bad induction, example 2.


Use induction to prove that 8n+3 is even for all positive integers n.

(What happens when we skip the base case?)

We assume inductive hypothesis -- 8k+3 is even for soe fixed positive integer k.
    We must show that 8(k+1) + 3 is even

    If 8k+3 is even, then there exists an integer a such that 8k+3 = 2a

    We have that:
        8(k+1) + 3 = 8k + 8 + 3
                   = 2a + 8 (by inductive hypothesis)
                   = 2(a + 4)
